# Project to learn about using API's

The App fetches a random quote from an API and also alows you to search for quotes. Clicking on Yoda will translate the current quote to the way Yoda would say it. You can find a live demo at https://dennishemstra.com/advice/ or check out my Codepen: https://codepen.io/Dennisch/full/mdoPmLL
